The following concerns were detected within MODPARAMS.DAT

** Note ** - Multiple ADD values for ADD_GBLSECTIONS found.
        VMS value (280) combining with MODPARAMS value (512)
        Value used is 792

** Note ** - Multiple MIN values found for MIN_GBLSECTIONS.

    This kit contains an Installation Verification Procedure
    (IVP) to  verify  the  correct  installation of the
    Compaq C++ compiler component and  class library headers.
    The IVP will be placed in:

                SYS$TEST:CXX$IVP.COM

    After the  installation  is complete, you can invoke the
    command file at any time to reverify that Compaq C++ is
    installed and working correctly.   If you wish to invoke
    it automatically  at the completion of this installation
    procedure, answer Yes to the following question.

* Do you want to run the IVP after this installation  [YES]? <b><i>&lt;return&gt;</i></b>


    The C Runtime Library, and C++ Class Library,  headers
    will be installed as Text Libraries (.TLBs).   If you 
    also wish to install the traditional text form  of the
    headers (.H and .HXX  files) for  reference  purposes,
    please answer yes to the following question.  The text
    headers will be placed in a subdirectory that will not
    be searched  by the compiler.   Instead, they  will be
    placed the subdirectory tree: 

            SYS$COMMON:[CXX$LIB.REFERENCE...]

    (SYS$COMMON:[DECC$LIB.REFERENCE...] for the Compaq C RTL
    header library, DECC$RTLDEF, and the system definition
    header library, SYS$STARLET_C.)

    Note that doing this may double the disk space used for
    the headers.

* Do you want to install the text form of the headers?  [YES]? <b><i>&lt;return&gt;</i></b>


    The Compaq C++ compiler component requires a Product
    Authorization Key (PAK) for Compaq C++ to be registered and
    loaded.   Answer the following question with YES if a PAK
    with the specified product name and a date equal to or
    later than the date shown is registered and loaded, otherwise
    answer NO.

    All questions and validations regarding the installation of Compaq C++
    kit components have now been asked.  Depending upon your configuration,
    time estimates for the installation(s) are as follows:

    Compiler/Linker/Library:   2  minutes

    Release notes are available in SYS$HELP:CSWS0200.RELEASE_NOTES. 
 
    
    hp highly recommends that you read these release notes.
    
    For the most up-to-date documentation, including release notes,
    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), and information about configuring 
    and running the hp Secure Web Server, please see the web pages at:
    
    http://www.hp.com/products/openvms/securewebserver
    
 
    Post-installation tasks are required for the hp Secure Web Server.
 
    
    The OpenVMS Installation and Configuration Guide gives detailed directions.
    This information is a brief checklist.
    
    
    Configure OpenVMS aspects of the hp Secure Web Server by:
    
        $ @SYS$MANAGER:APACHE$CONFIG
    
    If the OpenVMS username APACHE$WWW does not exist, you will be
    prompted to create that username.  File ownerships are set to UIC 
    [APACHE$WWW], etc.
    
    After configuration, start the hp Secure Web Server manually by 
    entering:
       
        $ @SYS$STARTUP:APACHE$STARTUP
    
    Check that neither SYLOGIN.COM nor the LOGIN.COM write any output to 
    SYS$OUTPUT:.  Look especially for a 
    
        $ SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE.
                   
    Start the hp Secure Web Server at system boot time by adding the
    following lines to SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:
         
        $ file := SYS$STARTUP:APACHE$STARTUP.COM
        $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'
         
    Shutdown the Apache server at system shutdown time by adding the 
    following lines to SYS$MANAGER:SYSHUTDWN.COM:
             
        $ file := SYS$STARTUP:APACHE$SHUTDOWN.COM
        $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'
    
    Test the installation using your favorite Web browser.
    Replace host.domain in the following URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
    with the information for the hp Secure Web Server just installed,
    configured, and started.
    
    
    URL http://host.domain/ should display the standard introductory page
    from the Apache Software Foundation. This has the bold text "It 
    Worked! The Apache Web Server is Installed on this Web Site!" at the 
    top  and the Apache server logo prominently displayed at the bottom.
    If you do not see this page, check the hp Secure Web Server 
    release notes, particularly the Frequently Asked Questions section.
    
    If you'd like to use secure connections with the hp Secure Web Server
    then you'll need to create a server certificate.  We recommend that 
    you start by creating a 30 day self signed certificate using the 
    following certificate tool:
    
        $ @APACHE$COMMON:[OPENSSL.COM]OPENSSL_AUTO_CERT.COM
    
    Once the certificate has been created you'll need to uncomment the 
    following directive in the APACHE$COMMON:[CONF]HTTPD.CONF file to 
    enable SSL.
    
        Include /apache$root/conf/ssl.conf
    
    Thank you for using the hp Secure Web Server.

UnZip 5.42 of 14 January 2001, by Info-ZIP.  For more details see: unzip -v.

Usage: unzip [-Z] [-opts[modifiers]] file[.zip] [list] [-x xlist] [-d exdir]
  Default action is to extract files in list, except those in xlist, to exdir;
  file[.zip] may be a wildcard.  "-Z" =&gt; ZipInfo mode (`unzip "-Z"' for usage).
=&gt; define foreign command symbol in LOGIN.COM:  $ unzip :== $dev:[dir]unzip.exe

  -p  extract files to pipe, no messages     -l  list files (short format)
  -f  freshen existing files, create none    -t  test compressed archive data
  -u  update files, create if necessary      -z  display archive comment
  -x  exclude files that follow (in xlist)   -d  extract files into exdir

modifiers:                                   -q  quiet mode (-qq =&gt; quieter)
  -n  never overwrite existing files         -a  auto-convert any text files
  -o  overwrite files WITHOUT prompting      -aa treat ALL files as text
  -j  junk paths (do not make directories)   -v  be verbose/print version info
 "-C" match filenames case-insensitively    "-L" make (some) names lowercase
 "-X" restore owner/protection info         "-V" retain VMS version numbers
                                            "-M" pipe through "more" pager
Examples (see unzip.txt for more info):
  unzip data1 -x joe   =&gt; extract all files except joe from zipfile data1.zip
  unzip "-V" foo "Bar" =&gt; must quote uppercase options and filenames in VMS
  unzip -fo foo vms.c  =&gt; quietly replace existing vms.c if archive file newer

               *********************

You have the option of saving directories, files, and libraries
that are replaced, modified, or deleted by the installation of
this remedial kit.  These files along with a copy of the product
database will be stored on the system disk in a separate
directory tree.  Choosing to save this recovery data will allow
you to uninstall this patch at a later time using the PRODUCT
UNDO PATCH command.  If recovery data is not saved you will not
be able to remove this remedial kit from your system.

               **** WARNING ****

If you choose to install this kit without saving recovery
data, you will lose your ability to uninstall any previously
installed remedial kits for which recovery data has been saved.

Do you wish to save this recovery data [YES] ?: <b><i>&lt;return&gt;</i></b>

               *********************

Recovery data will be saved which will allow you to un-install
this kit.  In the past, kit installations provided some level
of recovery capability by renaming all replaced files to
file_name.ext_OLD.  If you wish, you can continue to do this.

Note that this will triple the disk space required for
this kit - one for the installed files, once for the saved
recovery data and once for the file_name.ext_OLD files.

    Installing this patch kit requires a reboot.
 
    
    Compaq  strongly  recommends that you reboot your system
    immediately after installation  of  this kit.  The images
    in this kit will not fully take effect until the system
    is rebooted.  However, if you do not re-boot immediately
    after kit installation, the system may become unstable and
    may not function as expected.
    
    If you have other nodes in your VMS cluster, they must also
    be rebooted in order to make use of the new image(s).  If it
    is not possible or convenient to reboot the entire cluster
    at this time, a rolling re-boot (kit installation and reboot
    on one node at a time) may be performed.
