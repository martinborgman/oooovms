Initial release, long long long ago

Initial distributed releasae

021 1-jun-2003
1. Allow the help page to be scrolled in horizontal direction also.
2. Search actions can be in all selected libraries

0211 23-jul-2003
1. Bugfix. If you wanted to extract a module either to file or to printer
           from a textlibrary, the first record containing a / in the first
           columns would be seen as a terminator (as in a helplibrary). This
           problem is solved.

0212 19-aug-2003
1. The display in show open libs/modules counted the bytes loaded twice.
2. FSHELP now supports the /BINARY qualifier for the display of 
   non-printable data as occurs in printer libraries.

0213 24-dec-2003
1. Better support for the /WHOLE qualifier when searching text in the
   display. The cursor will go to the x,y pos of the found string. Before
   this patch the cursor remained on col 1 of the line where the string was
   found. This was confusing if the string occurred more than once on a line.
2. Include option in display help text to display the data in VMS-dump
   format via the KP6 key, and a /BINARY qualifier.
3. Changed the layout of the select window. If a topic has subtopics starting
   with a slash (as after the most Qualifiers topic), this topic will
   be the only one on a new line. This makes the layout more like
   VMS-help.
4. Included the KP6 key to toggle display from text to dump format (/BINARY).

0300 2-sep-2004
1. Support for IA64, including the ana/obj for most of the sections.
   Since the LBR$MAP_MODULE in only supported on IA64, the object data from
   ELF(IA64) object libraries can only be viewed on IA64 platforms.
2. The bytecount/linecount if the show open libs/mods was not updated for
   the ana/obj modules. This has been fixed.

0301 28-sep-2004
1. Included index for help messages.
2. Improved token parsing for help/message. Keywords like violation, are now
   found (the , is skipped).
3. Now supports searches in the help/message display (and its index)
0302 8-dec-2004
1. Allow see also's to jump to a specific line/col in the help page.
   Upto now you could only jump to the beginning of the page
2. Added the /CURRENT switch. This allows you to specify a library
   in your current directory i.s.o the SYS$SHARE default
   so HELP/CURRENT/LIBR=test  searches TEST.* in your current directory.
0303 17-oct-2005
1. If the first paramter start with an @, FSHELP will treat this parameter
   as a library name. If the user gave an explicit library with the
   /library, FSHELP will treat the @ first parameter as a help token now.
  
2. There were some modules missing for the alpha/ia64 build. They are
   added now.

  Since I no longer have access to an IA64 system, the objects/images for
  IA64 are from the 0300 version. To the best of my knowledge the kit
  will compile/build now, but I cannot test it.
