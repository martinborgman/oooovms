    <p>PAX is the POSIX.2 Portable Archive eXchange utility. With PAX you can read and write tar and cpio formatted archives.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Because the GNV tar utility is unable to extract all the files from the OpenOffice.org source distribution, I started to look for alternatives. I first started with GNU tar, but found it a bit hard to port. GNU tar depends on UNIX structures that we don't have on OpenVMS (jet). So after looking for alternatives I found PAX. I found several source distributions on the internet, and one of them looked quite easy to port. So I started with that particular one. The only real problem I had (and still have) is with the stat structure on OpenVMS (see issuelist on this site).<br /></p>
      <p>The current version of PAX extracts all the files from the OpenOffice.org source distribution. As of this writing I have no idea if you can extract files from a cpio archive and I doubt that you can successfully create a tar or cpio archive with this version.<br /></p>
      <p>Regards,<br /></p>
