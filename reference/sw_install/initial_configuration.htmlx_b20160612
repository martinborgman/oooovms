We prepared a disk containing the files we need during the following

layered and third party products are collected. In the direcctory [build]
are the hobbyistlicense files obtained from the hobbyist program.
You may need to edit the files to remove the linewrapping.

We increase the pagefilesize quite dramaticly because we expect to work
with a few people on the build of OpenOffice. As this is a mayor project we don't
want to run into a 'pagefile badly fragmented' situation...;-)
If you work alone or are just doing 'normal' things you probably won't need
to increase the pagefilesize.

We discovered in the early porting days that using shadowed disks
not only saved the day in case of diskfailures, but that avoiding the '$'
sign in disknames made porting more easy. Unix (and thus GNV) thought that
whereever there is a $ sign, it had to do something we didn't expect...;-)
So every disk we use is at least a single member shadowset.

  AUTOGEN was run from SAVPARAMS to SETPARAMS using FEEDBACK


Processing Parameter Data files
-------------------------------

Including parameters from: SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT

The following concerns were detected within MODPARAMS.DAT

** Note ** - Multiple ADD values for ADD_GBLSECTIONS found.
        VMS value (280) combining with MODPARAMS value (512)
        Value used is 792

** Note ** - Multiple MIN values found for MIN_GBLSECTIONS.
        Using MODPARAMS value (2000) which is superseding VMS value (600)

** Note ** - Multiple MIN values found for MIN_GBLPAGES.
        Using MODPARAMS value (40000000) which is superseding VMS value (150000)

** WARNING ** - The system was up for less than 24 hours (uptime = 0 hrs)
   when the feedback information was recorded. This could result in feedback
   information that does not accurately reflect your typical workload.
   However, this feedback information will be used in this run.

Feedback information was collected on 22-APR-2004 15:02:39.63
  Old values below are the parameter values at the time of collection.
  The feedback data is based on 0 hours of up time.
  Feedback information will be used in the subsequent calculations

We don't need the transaction log, but we don't mind it being there.
So just get rid of the nasty warning during the boot.

By the way you can disable the transaction manager completely if you want.
Add the following line to the SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGICALS.COM command procedure:

	<blockquote>
	<pre>
$ !
$ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXECUTIVE_MODE SYS$DECDTM_INHIBIT yes
$ !

	<p>
This stops the TP_SERVER process being created the next time you boot the system.

As we will be accessing a lot of help libraries, make it as fast as possible..
