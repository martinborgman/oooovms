   Description of the first boot of Alpha OpenVMS.</h2>
  <p>
  <hr>
  <blockquote>
	First you have to make certain that your Alpha-computer has the latest (supported) firmware loaded.
<BR>
See the <a href="firmware.html">description of a firmware update</a> on an Alpha computer.
<br>
<br>
After that you installed OpenVMS. See the <a href="install_os.html">description of the OpenVMS installation</a>.
<br>
<br>
As no more information is needed by the procedure, all you have to do is sit and wait for the final boot to complete.
<br>
This step will normally take less then 5 minutes to complete.
