34. Fixed bug in set output_filter, it just did not work.
35. Added the /radix=nn (nn=2..36) as more general /hex/oct..
36. Enhanced the editting in decwindows mode
37. Added a debug mode for scripts. @script/debug will enter a debugger
      See the help about "interactive_commands debugger"
38. Added the $DOINDEX special symbol for the index of the DO nn "command"
39. Added the "set/show prefix","show process" and the "show prompt" command
40. Added the $ARCHITECTURE special symbol (VAX,ALPHA,IA64)
41. Added the F$HASH_PASSWORD function
42. Added the f$cvtime lexical function
43. Fixed a bug in fastio sequential files on VAX. Dix would not set EOF 
    correctly.
44. Added the f$match_cond function and the load/mess to load dix message definitions
45. Changed key highlighting for output to files. The default is now off.
V0700 16-jun-2008
1. Fixed a definition error in bucketheaders/dataheaders in fastio. Some
   fields were defined bytesize while they were wordsize.
2. Added the option to open files by fileid. See the help about
   parameters.
3. Replaced the THISFIELD symbol by the more general $FIELD symbol
   in link structures in description records
4. Added f$left,f$right,f$fis,f$fnis,f$translate lexical functions
5. There was a small bug in repositioning in screen mode after redisplay.
6. Integer*1 (in fieldmode) was disallowed, this has been fixed
7. Added the /range qualifier to the POINTER statement, to disallow following
   the link if no valid pointer is present (see the help record_f field pointer)
8. Added a description for the accountng file (its fun)
9. Fixed a problem using block mode on indexed files
10. Fixed problems depositing in raw mode. Dix would not accept "deposit offset=value"
11. Allowed decriptions for block mode access (see also 12).
12. Added default descriptions $PROLOGUE,$KEY,$AREA,$BUCKET to allow easier
    patching in indexed files in block mode (be very careful)
13. Updated the WRITE command to allow output to an opened file.
    This prevents a lot of file open/closes when copying a lot of records
14. If a logical operator & or | and both parts are integer, the result is integer
    Previous versions of DIX returned a logical value
15. Added the option for the open to create the file with an optional FDL file
    See the help about open (interactive open /fdl)    
16. Enhanced the dimension of tables to allow for negative increment 
    You can now specify f.e. table(10:1:-1) = table(10)..table(1)
17. Added datatype bytearray. THis allows the display of a number of bytes
    in one line
18. Added the BLOCK/ENDBLOCK structure. This is the same as a RANG/ENDRANGE
    but after reaching the ENDBLOCK, the offset is not changed
19. Added new datatypes [bkt]rfa. The bktrfa is the rfa as stored in the
    bucket of indexed files and has a length of 4, 5 or 6 bytes.
    the rfa is the normal rfa type structure
20. Added support to reference parts of a field via the fieldname{bitname}
    See the help record_f field subfield
21. Support for parameters has been extended. Previous versions of DIX only
    allowed integer parameters, this version allows all supported types.
    If the expression cannot be evaluated during the read of the description,
    (if the expression depends on field-values), DIX will evaluate the
    expression at expand time (when a record has been read).
22. New values for F$FILE (BLOCKED,FIXED,RECORDLENGTH,MAXRECORDLENGTH,
            MINRECORDLENGTH,FILEID,DEVNAM,PARFILEID,PARNAME)
23. Fixed a bug in fastio. If the file is fixed and key and data compression are off
    the data bucket does not contain a recordlength (it it the file.maxrecl).
    The  previous version of DIX assumed there was a length word.
24. Added a verify option for indexed files. This will check indexed files for 
    corrupt buckets. See the help about dix/verify
25. Added a help text how to repair corrupt indexed files. See the help in
    dix/help mode verify
26. Added the GREP interactive command
27. Added the show file/fdl. This will output an FDL file te be used with the
    create file/fdl or the open/crea/fdl
28. Allow multiple commands on a line separated by ; in interactive mode
    See the help about "interactive_commands"
29. Add a do command. THis allows you to repeat a command a number of times
    f.e.  do 10 exam ; next rec
30. Modified the analyze qualifier of info to be on the top level
    DIX /ANALYZE instead of DIX/INFO/ANALYZE 
    See the help about "dix mode analyze "
31. Added dimensions to symbols, You can declare a symbol to be a table 
    (of max 3 dimensions) of any supported symbol type.
    You can assing multiple values like declare a(10,10); a(1:3,*) = 10
    See the help interactive symbols
32. Added the auto save mode. This allows you to exit DIX, and restart
    it with the same settings (files/records, and recall buffer)
    See the help about dix/restore
33. Fixed a problem with date conversion. DIX would complain while
    it a was a valid date. THis has been solved.
34. Added the F$PARSE,F$SYMBOL and the F$SEARCH function.
35. Allowed the f$TYPE, F$FTYPE argument to be specified without the
    quotes around the name. THis looks a bit more like DCL 
36. Allow deposit to modify multiple fields. Also updated the UNDO command
    to undo the change of the last deposit.
37. Added the directory command in interactive mode with some extra's
    See the help interact direc
38. Added the ** (exponentiation) operator
39. FIxed a problem with the <= test, it would only check for <
40. Added the MINIDX and MAXIDX functions for the min/max element of a table
41. Added the set integer size 8 on vax. Computations are done via real*16
42. Added the "FOR symbol IN Expression". This allowes enumeration for the
    for loop like " for k in [1,5,20]" or even " for k in "ABCD"{*} "
43. The /record now accepts an expression. This allows you to do some 
    computation like /record="f$getdvi(""mydisk"",""FID"",1234)"
44. Allow for character ranges "A":"Z" delivers a string ABC...XYZ
45. Added the set/show default command
46. Added the "one-line" command file. This allows you to specify a
    list of commands on one line Example DIX>; for k=1,10 ; eval k;endfor
    See the help in DIX INTERACTIVE
47. Added support for datafiles containing EBCDIC data.
48. Added the F$GETSYI function
49. Added a SWITCH/CASE/ENDSWITCH to the description syntax
50. Added a SWITCH/CASE/ENDSWITCH command for interactive mode
51. Increased the performance for scripts (at least if verb substitition is
     off).
52. Added the datatype privilege (64 bits with the known names) 
53. Added the VIEWS, see the help about views DIX/HELP VIEW
54. Added the set quoted command to change the printing of strings
55. show symbol $status is default in hex.
56. Added global parameters (see the LOAD and PARAMETER command)
57. Allow parameters for F$GETSYI and F$GETDVI to be integers (parameters
     f.e. loaded via the LOAD STARLET/MODULE=$SYIDEF)
58. Added SQRT function (square root)
59. added the f$numtim, f$vectim function
60. Allow a (table) result in an expression to be subsetted with a dimension
       f$numtim()(1:3) : deliver a 3 element integer table instaed of a 7.
61. Enhanced support for unsigned integers.
61. Added a Unix date/time spec (#seconds sinc 1-jan-1970)
62. Allow links to other files with RFA/BYTEOFFSET.
63. Added F$FID_TO_NAME function
64. The () in the IF statement are no longer required, so IF A>1 say "yes"
     will work now, as well as IF (A>1) say "Yes" 
64. Added the F$SPLIT function
V0600 28-nov-2006
1. Added a decwindows interface to DIX.
2. If you changed data in the "all_formats" display and then returned,
   the screen was not updated. This has been fixed.
3. Fixed a bug in fastio, when searching for multiple-records, FASTIO
   could not correctly reset the RFA.
4. Changed the "all_format" display to allow a discard of changes via the
   F10 key or an accept of changes via the Do key.
5. Included the current key of indexed files in the header in screen mode
6. Add the the /keyboard=keyboardtype and the "set keyboard keyboardtype"
   command, added the ^F,^G, ^K,^L as pf1..pf4 for keyboard=laptop
7. Allow the /record=-10 : Start 10 records before EOF
8. Added the /LIMIT qualifier for a file. Record beyond the limit
   will return the limitreached message.
9. Added the /progess qualifier for interactive search
10. Added the ^T for search progress
11. For fastio and stream-files the VT and FF were not recognized as
    terminators. This has been solved.
12. Fixed a bug on reading previous records when the key has duplicate keys.
13. Fixed an ACCVIO in dix/inter file/nodes/raw : examine command
14. Changed the fastio option to be more general. You can now also open
    "locked" files. DIX will open the file in fastio mode (ignoring
    RMS locks) and allow you to read records (keyed, relative, sequential)
15. IN raw mode in the ascii part the moving around went wrong. THis has
    been solved. 
16. If Recordsize >32767 we now return rms$_IRC in fastio mode
17. In interactive mode the WRITE function has been enhanced to write
    more than one record
18. DIX now saves the byte offset and the binary/ascii setting over
    switching to different (screen-) display modes. The setting is also
    saved over record switching.
19. Added a RMS analyze option for indexed files. THis gives a lot of detail
    about rms internal structures. See the "DIX/help modes info/analyze"
v0510 8-jun-2006
1. Added the #IFDEF function for conditional expansion of descriptions
2. Fixed a problem with "fixed" symbols. If you explicitly declare a
   symbol with a type, DIX did not always forbid you to change the type.
3. Added the /FAST qualifier for the search commands. If you use this
   qualifier, DIX will bypass RMS, and it may be faster. See the help
    dix/help record_search/fast
4. Allow /record on indexed files, together with the /key, you now can
   read record "n" on key "key"
5. Allow search selection on record_length with lt,le,eq,ge,gt and range.
6. Included a /rfa= qualifier to select a specific record.
   the previous /rfa qualifier is replaced with the /mark. See the help

1. Enhanced the wrap. Sometimes DIX would wrap output lines when not necessary.
2. Enhanced qualifiers for the DUMP command.
3. Changed the record header for dump/file to a one line display containing
   recordlength,recordnumber,vfc_record size and RFA. The output to symbols 
   is still separated.
4. Fixed some integer*8 problems
5. Added the FILECOUNT() function.
6. Enhanced the values for /FIELD and /SELECT to optionally include a
   filenamemask and descriptionmask
7. Changed the name of the BINASC key (TAB) to NEXT_WINDOW.
8. Fixed a small problem with the /next_record search qualifier.
9. Added the /FORMAT qualifier and the SET/SHOW format command, to allow
   the display of unprintable data in character strings.
10. Fixed a bug in the raw screen display with scrolling. If the data contained
     more than one screen, the display went wrong.
11. Inluded the MOUSE-usage on a decwindows-terminal, and menu_key in screenmode.
12. Included the context for a key definition. This allow you to define
     keys with different meaning in different screens. 
13. Added funtions BTEST, IBSET and IBCLR (bit manipulation)
14. There was a problem with hex input for character fields, that has been solved
15. Fixed some (non-)alignment problems on VAX
16. Fixed the (signed) display of bytes and words. They were converted as unsigned data
17. Included the DEMO mode
18. Added the RFA of the current record to the header in screen mode (thanks to Hein)
19. Fixed an error when doing screen_print and leaving the filename empty.
20. Added binary and octal display in all modes
21. Added support for previous record for an indexed and a relative file
22. Changed the key PF1-H to PF4-H and v.v.
23. Changed the search order for .des files, first currentdir, then filedir
     then userlib and finally systemlib
24. Added fieldnames for dates (none, expired etc). If you have your own descriptions
    with date types, make sure you add the [0=none] to the description line
25. Added new datatype deltatime
26. Added symbol substitution for verbs. 
27. Added the f$mode and the f$radix function
28. Added the decimal symbol type and the [u]decimal datatype.
29. The set strict command is now per level. Each @file can set its own.
30. Added the f$verify function.
31. Removed the "onelinecommand" from interactive mode, but added a
    /command=("command1","command2",..) qualifier.

V0430 21-jan-2006
1. Greatly enhanced the record search. You can now search in (fields of)
   multiple records with a lot of compare options. See the help about
   record_seaches.
2. In the interactive mode , the FIND and SEARCH commands have be changed.
   THe FIND now searches data in the record, the SEARCH records in the file.
3. Added the SHOW SEARCH, SET SEARCH and the EDIT SEARCH commands.
4. Added the set integer size 8 on alpha and ia64 (sorry not on vax)
   This allows symbols with 64 bit integers and all operations on them.
   Fields with 64 bit integers have always been supported.
5. Enhanced the CSV in dump/file.
6. Included a DUMP command in interactive mode (including a CSV qualifiers)
7. There was a problem with the make-file. The procedure used an undefined 
   symbol SAY. This problem is solved.
8. There was a link problem with older (pre 7.3 Alpha) versions of VMS.
   DIX used the routines OTS$CVT_T_S (concert text to bin for REAL*4 IEEE)
   and OTS$CVT_T_T (convert text to bin for REAL*8(IEEE). I replaced 
   these routines, and this problem should no longer occur.
V0421 1-jan-2006
1. Added the %Recordnumber() function
2. Fixed a bug in the create record when no description available

7. Added the set file/[no]modify in interactive mode
8. Added the /relative qualifier for the position in the descriptions
  I have access to an IA64 machine now, so the kit now again includes
  the IA64 objects and binaries
V0412 28-oct-2005
1. Added f$add, f$sub, f$mul and F$divide
2. Added recall statement in the interactive mode

1. Added the /LIMIT qualifier to stop a repeat sequence
2. Added the POINTER statement to allow pointer in records
   See the help about pointer_syntax
3. Added support for IEEE reals. We now accept the real types
   REAL_F,REAL_G,REAL_D,REAL_H,REAL_S,REAL_T,REAL_X
   REAL*nn are accepted as aliases, with different policies for
   the different platforms (see the help). 
4. Added the SET REAL FORMAT, and SET REAL SIZE command to
   allow the real symbols in any (supported) precision.
5. Changed the EXIT command to do the exit dependend on data.
6. Leave the text on screen after EXIT (screen mode).
7. Better support for VFC files. In screen mode the screen will display
   two displays (one for the data and one for the VFC data).
8. The /EQ,/LT,/LE,/GE,/GT,/RECORD are now position dependend
   So you can now open mulitple files, each with their own record specification.
9. Added the /locking qualifier . See the help
10. Major rewrite for the RMS library
11. Added /CSV in file mode, This allows you to generate a CSV 
   (comma separated values) file for import to excell
12. Fixed a bug for the RBITS value. This conversion did not function 
    correctly when you specified field=+value (addition of one bit).


  Since I no longer have access to an IA64 machine, I cannot compile the
  newer versions. I successfully compiled the 4.0 version to IA64, so it should
  be possible to build dix0410 and later on IA64, if you have the fortran compiler.

V0400 13-sep-2004
1. Added user defined types. See help about user defined types.
   This allowes the user to define his own datatypes.
2. Added function NOT, ODD, EVEN
3. Fixed bug in label accessibility. Sometimes lables could not
   be found, while they should have been found.
4. Fixed bug in interactive mode. When depositing text all text was 
   uppercased.

V0310 1-apr-2003 
Initial distributed release

V0100 1-jan-1991
First release, it was a long time ago


V9999
Known restrictions.
1.
 When using GOSUB, the RETURN statement must be at the same syntax level
 as the entry point. This is NOT checked, and violation will result in
 strange behaviour. This problem does not exist with the CALL statement.
 Example
  IF (exp) THEN
    Statement
    WHILE (expr)
      Statement
      GOSUB test
    ENDWHILE
  test:           -
    Statement     |
  ENDIF           | Gosub/return block runs into an endif
 statement        | Not supported
 RETURN           -

  IF (exp) THEN
    Statement
    WHILE (expr)
      Statement
      GOSUB test
    ENDWHILE
   goto lab1	 Do not runinto, since RETURN will be unexpected
  test:           -
    statement     | Gosub/return block at the same syntax level
    Statement     | This is supported
    RETURN        _ 
 lab1:
  ENDIF           

2. For the not-native real values 
    a.REAL_S, REAL_T and REAL_H on VAX
    b.REAL_H                    on Alpha/IA64
    c.REAL_F, REAL_G and REAL_D on IA64

   Conversions are done via tranformations to the other equivalent types

    a. REAL_S via REAL_F, REAL_T via REAL_G, REAL_X via REAL_H on VAX
    b. REAL_H via REAL_X on Alpha/IA64
    c. REAL_F via REAL_S, REAL_G and REAL_D via REAL_X on IA64

   Since not all types have exactly the same range, some data will convert
   to overflow on one platform, and not on the other. This will only happen
   on data near the edge of the range, and should not make a difference
   for normal values.
